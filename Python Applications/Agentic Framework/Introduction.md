#### What is an AI agent?
- An AI agent is a computational system designed to autonomously percieve its environment, make decisions and takes action to achieve specific goals.
- It acts as a bridge between its internal capabilities such as reasoning, learning and problem solving in the external environment it interacts with by leveraging abilities, predefined goals and prior knowledge, an agent can gathers information, gathers data and execute task effectively.

- Agent:
  - An AI agent is a computational system designed to autonomously percieve its environment, make decisions and takes action to achieve specific goals
  - Think of it as smart orchestrator, it access the core entity that integrates its ability, goals and prior knowledge to interact with external env
- Abilities:
  - Refers to agent capabilities such as reasoning, learning, problem solving or interacting with APIs
  - These define what agent can do, like fetching data, generating insights or controlling devices
- Goals
  - Specific objectives or tasks the agent is designed to achieve
  - These drive the decision making process, ensuring agents works purposefully to fulfill a mission
    - Retrieving bitcoin prices
    - Optimizing a schedule
- Prior Knowledge
  - This includes pre-existing data models or rules, agent uses to make informed decisions
    - Eg: Pre-trained ML models, domain knowledge or previously observed data
   

An AI agent operates in a continuous feedback loop, it uses abilities to take action towards it goals, gathers observation from the environment and refines its prior knowledge for future decision making. The cycle enables the agent to adapt, learn, and function autonomously within dynamic or complex systems


#### Agentic Frameworks
- Software structures that facilitates the development of autonoumous agents
- AI entities is cabable of percieving their environment, making decisions and executing tasks independently
- These agents are integral to modern applications, driving automation and efficiency in sectors like customer service, healthcare and logistics
